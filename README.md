# LAB - Class 02

## About Me

I built an app that tells the user about me.  It includes a short biography and a list of a few of my favorite things.  It also quizzes the user visiting the site, through a series of promts, with the purpose of them learning about me.

Added additional questions and functionality, released on 10/25/23.  Created a section about my work experience and education.  Also added a top 10 list of my top places to visit.  Enjoy the additional quiz questions, you will have a set number of times to guess.

### Reflections and Comments

* I struggled a bit with the if statements and switch statement trying to make "yes" and "y" work correctly in the prompts.  It took me longer then I would have liked (finished outside of lab hours) but I was proud of myself for reviewing the lecture and demo in GitHub repo to figure it out.
* Primarily worked through this lab on my own but did chat and collaborate with class members at my table.  Requested help from TA to verify my (and other table members) folder structure was setup correctly.

* I struggled with the while loop to ask the question about my kids names.  I had to get help from ChatGPT to get it functioning and working.  I was unable to complete the 4th requirement (provide user with final score).  Ran out of time to start researching that one.

* I will also need to try and rename the repo to "About Me" at a later date.  Ran out of time for that too.

            <h2>Biography:</h2>
            <p>Hello!  My name is Jessica.  I'm from a small town in the great Pacific Northwest.  I was born and raised here and have also raised my own family here.  I'm married to my husband, Trevor, and have two boys Colby (20) and Carson (16) and two dogs. I work for a regional insurance company, in IT, as a Software Engineering Manager.  I'm currently enrolled at Code Fellows and looking forward to building great websites! </p>
